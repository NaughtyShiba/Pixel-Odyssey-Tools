In Pixel Odyssey, you have to step to encounter NPCs, Monsters, lootable Items (some local, some universal) and Mines. See the screenshot on the Main Page for a visual explanation.

There are Destinations you can travel to in between. At the beginning of the game you can only visit the first areas. As you progress by stepping, the next areas will become available for you to wander through and enjoy.
